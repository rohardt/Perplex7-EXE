# Perplex7-EXE
Perplex7 is based on MATLAB, so a Matlab license is required to use this software. An executable version of Perplex7 and WayPointsAlongTransect is available here for PCs with WIN10/11 (64bit).

Update of Perplex7, see Perplex7-Update.pdf.
New: Cast setup of stations can be cloned. This means that a defined sequence of devices used at a station can be easily copied for several consecutive waypoints.

NEW:
Instead of installing GRIDONEnc2mat.exe; see GRIDONEnc2mat_Installer_web.exe, the manual “Perplex7andMatlab_Online.pdf” describes a very simple way to convert the required file GRIDONE_2D.nc 
into a MAT file after the installation of Perplex7 ; see Perplex-Manual.pdf, page 3.
